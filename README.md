# Image-Processing-IP-Design-for-Demosaic-on-FPGA
Demosaic is a digital image processing technique that reconstructs a full-color image from the incomplete color samples obtained from an image sensor overlaid with a color filter array (CFA). 
This project mainly implements two algorithms: 
  1. HQL (https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1326587).
  2. 2. Hamiltonian (https://patents.google.com/patent/US5629734A/en).
